**Native CSS vs Frameworks:**

| Aspect | **Native CSS** | **Modern CSS Frameworks (e.g., Tailwind CSS)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Definition** | Standard CSS written directly, using core features like custom properties, grid, flexbox, cascade layers, container queries, etc. | Predefined utility or component-based class systems built on top of CSS to accelerate UI development. |
| **Ease of Use** | Requires strong understanding of CSS concepts and structure management. | Quicker to start with — predefined classes handle spacing, colors, and layouts. |
| **Customization** | Complete flexibility and control; style everything from scratch. | Customization possible but can become complex if deviating heavily from defaults. |
| **Performance** | Usually lighter — no framework overhead, minimal unused styles. | Can lead to larger CSS bundles (though frameworks like Tailwind use tree-shaking to minimize size). |
| **Maintainability** | Easy to maintain in smaller projects; can become challenging in large teams without a defined methodology (like BEM or CSS layers). | Consistent design language and structure improve scalability in teams. |
| **Ecosystem & Tooling** | Growing rapidly thanks to new native features (Cascade Layers, Nesting, :has(), Container Queries, etc.). | Mature ecosystem with plugins, docs, and integrations. |
| **Community Support** | Huge, as it’s a web standard supported by browsers and MDN docs. | Large and active, but depends on each framework’s popularity. |
| **Dependencies** | None | Requires Node, PostCSS, build tools. |
| **Future-Proofing** | Fully aligned with browser standards — always supported. | Framework-dependent. |
