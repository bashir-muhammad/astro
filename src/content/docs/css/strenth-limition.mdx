### **Strengths:**

- **Performance is paramount** (no JS parsing/execution overhead)
- **Progressive enhancement required** (works without JS)
- **Cross-framework portability needed** (design systems)
- **Accessibility is non-negotiable** (semantic styling)
- **SEO/first paint optimization critical** (static rendering)
- **Long-term maintenance** (stable specs, backward compatible)
- **Clear separation of concerns** (structure in HTML, style in CSS) can aid readability and maintainability if well-structured.

### **Limitations:**

- Slower for quick prototyping
- Requires architectural discipline
