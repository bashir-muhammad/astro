**CSS Preprocessors:**

1. **Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets):** Most popular preprocessor; widely used in legacy and modern projects alike. Decreasing in new projects.
2. **Less:** Popular earlier in the 2010s; now declining.

**CSS Frameworks:**

1. **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first, design tokens as classes. Explosive growth - Became dominant 2020-2024.
2. **Bootstrap:** One of the most widely used front-end frameworks; millions of websites.
3. **Bulma:** Medium-sized community; popular for simplicity and pure CSS (no JS).

**CSS Methodologies (Architecture Patterns)**

1.  **BEM** (Block Element Modifier)**:** Common in large-scale enterprise and modular CSS systems. Concept, not software — open and widely used.
2. **OOCSS** (Object-Oriented CSS): Influential but less formal adoption; more conceptual.
3. **SMACSS**: Smaller community; mostly used as a reference methodology.

**CSS-in-JS Libraries:**

1. **Styled Components**: Very large adoption in React ecosystem. Declining - Performance concerns, shift to zero-runtime solutions.
2. **Emotion:** Popular alternative to Styled Components, with a strong React user base. Used by major design systems (Chakra UI, Theme UI).
3. **Stitches:** Growing in modern React projects; backed by Modulz (now Radix UI team).
4. **JSS:** Once popular (used by Material-UI v4); now declining.

**PostCSS:**

Very large ecosystem; powers many tools (like Autoprefixer, Tailwind, etc.). Growing - Industry standard for CSS processing.

**Who Uses It:**

- Tailwind CSS (built on PostCSS)
- Next.js (default CSS pipeline)
- Vue CLI, Create React App
- Modern build toolchains

**Design Token Systems**

1. **Style Dictionary:** Transform design tokens to multiple formats (CSS, JS, iOS, Android).  Growing - Design system standard
2.  **Design Tokens Community Group** (W3C): Working draft specification. Will become standard for design token interchange
